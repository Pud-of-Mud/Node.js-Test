# Node.js Test
A test website for me to learn how to use node.js.

## Contents
* A date and time custom function module
* Birthday input and bool check if its today or not [WIP]
* HTML and CSS being read back from the server, live
* More coming soon

## Live Demo
Demo hosted by replit is at the following link: 
[thesweach.repl.co/](https://thesweach.repl.co/)

## Hosting
There are two was of hosting this repository:
* Replit / any github hosting platform
* Self-hosted

### Replit / github hosting platforms
1) Clone the repository within the platform of choice
2) The software should auto-config everything for you
3) run ``` npm install ``` within the console to install the dependances. 
4) Make the 'run' button configured to ``` node index.js ```
5) Hit 'run' within the software and it should be hosted on the URL provided by the hosting platform.  

### Self-hosting
This requires downloading the code from the repsitory. 
1) Download the code from either the experemential branch, or main. 
2) Set up the port you want to host on; default is **8080**
3) Run ``` npm install ``` within the console/terminal to install the dependances.
4) Run ``` node index.js ``` within the console/terminal.
5) You can find the website hosted on [localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080)
