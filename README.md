# Node.js Test
A test website for me to learn how to use node.js.

## Contents
* A date and time custom function module
* Birthday input and bool check if its today or not [WIP]
* HTML and CSS being read back from the server, live
* More coming soon

## Live Demo
Demo hosted by replit is at the following link: 
[thesweach.repl.co/](https://thesweach.repl.co/)

## Hosting
There are two was of hosting this repository:
* Replit / any github hosting platform
* Self-hosted

### Replit / github hosting platforms
1) Clone the repository within the platform of choice
2) The software should auto-config everything for you
3) Make the 'run' button configured to ``` npm start ```

### Self-hosting
This requires downloading the code from the repsitory. 
1) Download the code from either the experemential branch, or main. 
2) Set up the port you want to host on; default is **8080**
3) Run ``` npm install ``` within the console. 
4) Run ``` npm start ``` within the console.
